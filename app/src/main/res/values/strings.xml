        \nLong ago, the programmer and his family lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed
        when the fire nation attac- I mean, when the application came into existence. Only the
        programmer, the creator of this madness, could stop the world-ending disappointment that is
        this application, but when the programmer needed his family most, they vanished.
        \n
        \nA hundred years had passed and the programmer found a clue to locate his family, a note that said that
        his family disowned him. Although the programmer spent 69,420 years on detective work to
        find his family, he could never find any of them. He never understood what the initials XY
        on the envelope stood for.
        \n
        \nHow Unfortunate.
        \n
        \nDo not be like the programmer. Fear the initials.
